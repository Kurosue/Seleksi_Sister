## Prologue
I’m standing in the middle of Penacony’s wildest arcade, neon lights flashing like a fever dream, with Firefly clinging to my arm. Her silver hair catches the glow of a claw machine, and those big, galaxy-filled eyes of hers are locked on a plushie that looks suspiciously like an oak cake roll with googly eyes. “I... I really want that one,” she whispers, her voice all soft and shaky, like she’s confessing her deepest secret. I grin, feeling like the coolest guy in the universe. “Babe, I’ll win you that plushie if it’s the last thing I do,” I say, flexing like I’m about to hack the entire dreamscape. But then the arcade glitches—screens flicker, joysticks spark, and the whole place hums like it’s alive. Firefly gasps, her hand squeezing mine. “This place... it’s like it’s thinking!” she says, half-scared, half-awed. I catch a glimpse of a screen flashing “PARALLEL_PROCESSING_OVERLOAD” (ha, nice try, cosmic supercomputer), and I know we’re in for a ride.

The arcade warps, and suddenly we’re not just in Penacony anymore—it’s like we’re inside a starship’s mainframe, with pixelated stars swirling around us. Firefly’s SAM armor flickers on, her flames lighting up the chaos, but she’s still holding my hand, blushing like crazy. “You’re not scared, are you?” she teases, her shy smile making my heart do backflips. “Me? Scared? Nah, I’m just planning our next date in this... uh, galaxy arcade,” I shoot back, pretending I’m not freaking out as a holographic claw machine tries to grab us. I pull her close, dodging a rogue pixel comet. “Stick with me, Firefly. We’ll reprogram this mess and get that plushie.” She laughs, her voice like a melody in the static. “You’re so stubborn... but that’s why I love you.” Love? Did she just—? My brain short-circuits, but I’m already messing with the arcade’s controls, feeling like I’m threading a million parallel tasks to keep her safe and make her smile.

We end up on a floating platform, the glitchy arcade now a sea of stars, and Firefly’s leaning against me, her warmth cutting through the cold of this weird digital void. “You didn’t have to fight a whole arcade for me,” she murmurs, her fingers tracing mine, her oak cake roll plushie finally in her arms. I smirk, brushing a strand of hair from her face. “For you? I’d fight the whole damn universe, Firefly.” She blushes, her eyes brighter than Penacony’s skyline, and leans in for a quick kiss that makes the stars explode (or maybe that’s just the arcade crashing). “Let’s come back tomorrow,” she whispers, “but... maybe a quieter date?” I laugh, pulling her close as the arcade hums back to life. “Deal, babe. Just you, me, and a million oak cake rolls.” And as we walk out, hand in hand, I swear the screens flash “DISTRIBUTED_LOVE_SUCCESS” just for us.
